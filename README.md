Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The dataset used contains information about customers, including their annual income and spending score. The goal is to group the customers into distinct clusters based on their behavior.

Libraries Used
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Workflow
Importing Libraries: Import necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
Loading the Dataset: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and perform initial exploration.
Data Preprocessing: Check for and handle any missing values or duplicates in the dataset.
Feature Selection: Select relevant features for clustering.
Optimal Number of Clusters: Use the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Training the K-Means Model: Train the K-Means model on the selected features.
Cluster Visualization: Visualize the resulting clusters and their centroids.
